# Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is trained to classify text data (e.g., movie reviews, product feedback) as positive or negative, helping in understanding customer sentiment.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, padding, etc.)
- RNN architecture for sequence modeling
- Binary classification (positive/negative sentiment)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-rnn.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-rnn
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py
   ```

## Model Architecture
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input tokens to dense vectors.
- **RNN Layer**: Captures sequential dependencies.
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs binary classification.

## Requirements
